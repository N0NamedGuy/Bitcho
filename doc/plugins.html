	<h2>Plugin System Overview</h2>
	<div>Every plugin is a python class. That python class must be written
	on a .py file, and be located on the plugins folder (or any subfolder).
	The plugin class must extend the <code>PluginBase</code> class,
	located on the plugin_base module. Here's a sample skeleton for a plugin
	that does nothing useful:<br/>
	
	<div>
		<code>
		from plugin_base import PluginBase<br/>
		<br/>
		class SamplePlugin(PluginBase):<br/>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def plugin_init(self):<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass<br/>
		</code>
	</div>
	
	Now, from this skeleton, we can do something more useful (or annoying).
	Let's make a greeter! Every time an user joins a channel the bot has
	joined, that same user will be greeted:<br/>
	
	<div>
		<code>
		from plugin_base import PluginBase<br/>
		<br/>
		class WelcomePlugin(PluginBase):<br/>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def plugin_init(self):<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.register_event("join", self.on_join)<br/>
        <br/>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def on_join(self, user, channel):<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.bot.send_msg(channel, "Welcome to %s, %s!" % (channel, user))<br/>
		</code>
	</div>
	
	First thing you may notice is the different name was given to the
	<code>PluginBase</code> subclass (<code>WelcomePlugin</code>). The bot does
	not care about the name you give to this class. Call it the name you want.
	Next, you are invited to look at the <code>plugin_init</code> method.
	You'll notice that a call to the <code>register_event</code> method is
	done. That's the way plugins should register themselves with events. In
	this case, this plugin registered the <i>join</i> event, as explicit by
	the first argument. The second argument should be a pointer to a function
	(or a method, or a bounded function, if you prefer), that will be a
	callback, for that event. Whenever the <i>join</i> event happens, the
	<code>self.on_join</code> method is called.
	<br/>
	When the code on <code>on_join</code> is run, the bot sends a message to
	the channel. The <code>self.bot</code> property is an instance of the
	running bot. Check the Bitcho class reference to know the methods and
	properties available.
	<br/>
	And there you go! A fully functional plugin!
